# PoreFlow.jl Documentation 

PoreFlow is a package for inverse modeling in geomechanics and fluid equations. Although many features of this package focus on geomechanics (linear elasticity, poroelasticity, plasticity, etc.) and single/multiphase flows, PoreFlow will also benefit other applications due to the general design and method. 

## Install PoreFlow.jl 

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PoreFlow")
```
